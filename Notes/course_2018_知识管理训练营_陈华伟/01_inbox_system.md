# Inbox System

## Feynman inbox
 - Inbox is like a Mailbox
    - **Quality control**: choose what infomation to put into the mailbox
    - **Tracking source**
        - Choose what you eat -> choose what you read
    - Deal with infomation 'asynchronously' and more efficiently
        - You don't need to check the mailbox constantly
        - Check it periodically
 - Empty your mailbox
    - Purpose: Take infomation into your knowledge system
        - In my case, the Knowledge Project
 - My inbox
    - TODO list is my inbox
    - Wechat, Zhihu, etc
        - Leave an entry in the TODO list as a reference
        - check them everyday/week (periodically)

## Important Ideas
 - What serves as your inbox
 - Empty your inbox, periodically

## 2 Misunderstanding
 - `Knowledge explosion` or `Infomation explotion`?
    - infomation explotion
    - Infomation: outside fragment
    - Knowledge: insode, systematic 
 - `Infomation overload` or `Infomation disorder`?
    - **The real problem is not overload, but disorder.**
    - Read a lot, but you don't really get everything

## Infomation is food for the brain
 - Sort out infomation source(using a mind map), know what is fed into the brain.
 - We should select what we eat.
 - Same for infomation.


## Infomation input should be concise
 - select what you read
    - Reading book
    - Reading wechat (don't see one's pyq if you think it doesn't help)
       - 5 people around you determine your success
    - Reading zhihu
 - Life is an infomation flow
    - what we input determine what we output


## Inbox system
 - knowledge -> inbox
    - real-time
 - inbox -> knowledge system
    - periodically
 - **Empty your inbox**
    - The key is not putting things into the inbox
    - but **taking things out to the knowledge system**
