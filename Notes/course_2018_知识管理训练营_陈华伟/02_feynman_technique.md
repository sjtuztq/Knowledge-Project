# Feynman Technique: Stop storing what you don't use

## Feynman Feynman Technique
 - Like climbing a hill, step by step
 - An iterative way for understanding a specific concept
    - specific
    - iterative
        - understanding it instantly is hard
        - breaking it into very simple points
        - break hard points into even simpler points
 - Final target:
    - 说人话，打比方
    - Break a hard concept into simple, organized structure
    - Create analogies

## Key points
 - Think when you read, find key points
 - Feynman Technique is an important study technique
    - definition: Speak in chinese
    - 用基础的，层层递进的，不断深入的方式去分解一个问题
    - How to apply Feynman Technique in taking notes

## Feynman 4 steps
 - Choose your concept
    - The concept you want to understand
    - which points out a direction
 - Present your idea to a student
    - write out an explanation
    - **as if** (not really) you were teaching someone
 - Whenever you get stuck, go back to the book
    - Actually it means any resource that helps you understand
    - Split a big concept into subpoints
    - Understand one by one
    - Solve those you don't understand
 - Simplify and create analogies
    - This is when you really understand it

## Apply Feynman in note taking
 - highlight (underline important things)
 - annotate the highlight
