## Keymaps and shortcuts
 - For HHKB, use F keys as F1-F12 instead of function keys that control volume, light, etc.
    - `Fn + A,S` as `Vol\_Up`, `Vol\_Down`
    - `Fn + D` as `Mute`
    - `Command + ;` for showing Launchpad
 - Other useful shortcuts
    - `Shift + Command + Y` for `Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Text > Add selected text to Yoink`  
    - `Command + Esc ` for `Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard > Move focus to next window`

 - Some known issues
    - `Command + Esc` doesn't scroll through full screen\
      Solution: maximize screen but not make them full screen
