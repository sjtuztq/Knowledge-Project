## Keymaps and shortcuts
 - For HHKB, use F keys as F1-F12 instead of function keys that control volume, light, etc.
    - `Fn + A,S` as `Vol\_Up`, `Vol\_Down`
    - `Fn + D` as `Mute`
    - `Command + L` for showing Launchpad
 - ``Command + Esc `` for switching between windows in an application.
    - To do this, go to `Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard` and reassigning "Move focus to next window" to `Command + Esc`
