## (Temporary)title: Deep sequential data analysis for visual object tracking

## Problem Definition
TODO


## Prerequisites
- machine learning Andrew Ng (coursera)
- cs231n (Stanford)
- digital image processing (https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-processing)
- deep learning book (for reference)

N.B.: Please feel free to skip certain courses if you have already been familiar with some topics


## Reference
- Mr Hua's PhD thesis, chapter 1 and 2 (http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/yhua/data/PhD\_thesis\_YangHua\_201606\_Release.pdf)
- Spatially Supervised Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Object Tracking (project link with code: http://guanghan.info/projects/ROLO/)
- Recurrent Filter Learning for Visual Tracking
- First Step toward Model-Free, Anonymous Object Tracking with Recurrent Neural Networks

## Plan
- Stage 1:  Check prerequisites and Mr Hua's PhD thesis chapter 1 and 2
Output: one group share session (deep learning book, chapter 10 Sequence Modeling: Recurrent and Recursive Nets )

- Stage 2: Check related papers and build baseline with ROLO code
Output: paper reading notes and baseline results.

- Stage 3: Certain improvements (To be confirmed and discussed)

- Stage 4: Write FYP report and prepare the defense
Output: thesis
