## Current plans
 - Spend some time on image processing
    - Basic methods
    - Concepts
    - Functions
    - Be brief
## About FYP
 - Image problems( Target: Recognition)
    - Classification
    - Detection
    - Segmentation
 - Tracking is a transitional problem(Image -> Video)
    - Problem def: Must have GT for the 1st frame, track the motion afterwards
    - Assumption about how human processes video: Motion analysis(fast) + Image processing(complicated, slow)
    - Know more about tracking:
        - Yang PhD Thesis first 2 chapters
        - Yang PhD graduate defence slides  
    - hard problem: single, short term, online
 - _Computer Vision_ book is recommended

## Future BIG plan
 1. Basics
    - Know more about image processing functions, basic concepts, methods
    - Know more about tracking
    - Tools
 2. ROLO
    - See results, limitations
 3. Furthermore
    - Think about imporvements
 4. Future
    - Does RNN/LSTM based methods help/work
    - Does sequence info work? how to improvement?
